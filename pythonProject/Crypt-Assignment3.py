# This is assignment 3 python code for Cryptography course 3626 - Feistel Cipher. The purpose of this assignment is to
# develop a program that replicates the encryption process of a Feistel Cipher but with limitations of only 1 round. The
# input would be string that represents a plaintext and any integer called key that is used to formulate the Feistel
# cipher's encryption (2 * Right half side of the binary input to the key, modulus 2 to the 4th). The list of encrypted
# binaries will then be used to generate a encrypted word that takes reference with the ASCII table using the functions
# developed from assignment 1.
